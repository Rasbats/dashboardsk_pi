== Simple gauge instrument

image::simplegaugeinstrument_screenshot.png[Simple gauge instrument]

A circular instrument displaying a single numerical value. Allows to select formatting and unit conversion from the SI units used by Signal K to usual units used in navigation. Multiple visual styles are available to cover absolute and relative directions, scalar values and proportions/percentages.

|Parameter |Description |Example

|Name
|Name of the instrument
|Time from primary GPS

|Title
|Title of the instrument to be displayed
|GPS Time

|Timeout
|Timeout in seconds. If the set numeber of seconds passes since the last update for the Signal K key displayed by the instrument pass without receiving an update, the value is considerd timed out and is replaced by dashes.
|3

|SK key
|Fully qualified Signal K path to the value displayed by the instrument

|Gauge type
a|Type of the gauge

.Gauge types
[cols="1h,5"]
!===
!Relative angle
!Displays angles relative to the boat (-180-180 degrees), eg. apparent or true wind. The `RAD -> DEG` transformation has to be used to convert the Signal K data from Radians to degrees.

!Direction
!Displays angle (0-360 degrees), eg. COG, heading or true wind direction. The `RAD -> DEG` transformation has to be used to convert the Signal K data from Radians to degrees.

!Percentile
!Percent value (0-100%). The `ratio -> %` transformation has to be used to convert the Signal K data to percent.

!Adaptive range indicator
!Arbitrary numerical value with adaptive range. The instrument scale is dynamically updated based on the received data.

!Fixed range indicator
!Arbitrary numerical value with fixed range. The instrument scale is static and set based on the minimal and maximal value set for the Zones. In case the actual value is out of the range, the needle is not displayed (but the numerical value in the center of the gauge is.)

|Format
a|Format of the displayed number.

.Supported formats
* 9.9
* 9.99
* 9.999
* 9
* 009
* 009.9
* 09.9
* 09.99
* 009.99
If displaying a sign in front of the number for negative values is undesirable, select the format marked by `ABS`, eg. `ABS(009)`.

|Transformation
a|Function to be used to convert the value from the SI unit used by Signal K to human readable form

.Supported transformation functions
* None
* RAD->DEG
* m/s -> kn
* m/s -> km/h
* m/s -> mph
* m -> feet
* m -> fathoms
* m -> NMi
* Kelvin -> Celsius
* Kelvin -> Fahrenheit
* ratio -> percent
* Pa -> hPa
* Pa -> kPa
* Pa -> MPa
* Pa -> atm
* Pa -> mmHg
* Pa -> psi
* Hz -> RPM

|Zones
|Value zones used to trigger visual alarm (Changing the colors of the instrument if the displayed value is within a zone). Refer to the xref:zones.adoc[detailed documentation].
|

|Data smoothing
|Degree of data smoothing. The value between 0 and 9 configuring how smooth the transition between values received from the data stream should be.

O means no smoothing, the latest value received from the data stream is directly displayed.

Values between 1 and 9 regulate how aggressive the smoothing algorithm is.

1 means the latest received value has 90% influence on what is displayed, 10% the earlier values. Lower values are suitable for data possibly changing fast in real world and the sensors with steady output, like depth.

9 means the latest received value has only 10% influence on the displayed value and 90% the earlier values. This makes the transition between values very smooth, not fluctuating wildly, but means a signifiant delay in reaching close to the actual value received from the sensor.
Higher values are suitable for data not changing fast in real world and coming from sensors suffering big fluctuation coming from boat movement and other factors, for example wind strength and direction.
