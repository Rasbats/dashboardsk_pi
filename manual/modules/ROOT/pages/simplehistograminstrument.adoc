image::simplehistograminstrument_screenshot.png[Simple gauge instrument]

A resctangular instrument displaying a single numerical value history. Allows to select formatting and unit conversion from the SI units used by Signal K to usual units used in navigation as well as the length of the history shown by the instrument.

|===
|Parameter |Description |Example

|Name
|Name of the instrument
|Time from primary GPS

|Title
|Title of the instrument to be displayed
|GPS Time

|Timeout
|Timeout in seconds. If the set numeber of seconds passes since the last update for the Signal K key displayed by the instrument pass without receiving an update, the value is considerd timed out and is replaced by dashes.
|3

|SK key
|Fully qualified xref:skkeys.adoc[Signal K path] to the value displayed by the instrument
|vessels.urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:76bb2350-c92e-4e47-b3c3-e12273f21155.environment.depth.belowTransducer

|Format
a|Format of the displayed number.

.Supported formats
* 9.9
* 9.99
* 9.999
* 9
* 009
* 009.9
* 09.9
* 09.99
* 009.99
If displaying a sign in front of the number for negative values is undesirable, select the format marked by `ABS`, eg. `ABS(009)`.

|Transformation
a|Function to be used to convert the value from the SI unit used by Signal K to human readable form

.Supported transformation functions
* None
* RAD->DEG
* m/s -> kn
* m/s -> km/h
* m/s -> mph
* m -> feet
* m -> fathoms
* m -> NMi
* Kelvin -> Celsius
* Kelvin -> Fahrenheit
* ratio -> percent
* Pa -> hPa
* Pa -> kPa
* Pa -> MPa
* Pa -> atm
* Pa -> mmHg

|Order
a|Order of values in the graph

.Value order
[cols="1h,5"]
!===
!Lowest to highest
!Lowest values drawn on top. Suitable for depth.

!Highest to lowest
!Highest values drawn on top. Suitable for speed etc.

|History
a|Length of the history shown by the instrument. Selectable between 1 minute and 3 days.

* The data for the last 1 minute are internally stored with resolution of 1 second.
* The data for the last 1 hour are internally stored with resolution of 10 seconds
* Older data are stored with resolution of 5 minutes

The data with different resolution are seamlessly combined together for longer time ranges.
