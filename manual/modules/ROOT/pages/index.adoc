== Plugin DashboardSK_pi

image::dashboardsk_pi_icon.png[DashboardSK logo]

=== Features

The plugin provides universal data display based on the https://signalk.org[Signal K] data model.
The data is displayed using configurable overlay instruments anchored to any edge of chart canvas.
The instruments may also be configured to trigger alarms based on the values they process.
For boats with only basic legacy NMEA 0183 data available, the https://opencpn-manuals.github.io/main/nsk/[NSK_pi plugin] provides conversion to the Signal K delta format allowing the user to use the DashboardSK plugin without the need to setup complex systems.

In any but the very basic scenario, it is preferable to run a real Signal K server. There is no need to setup a separate system for it, Signal K server can run on any machine running https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-windows[Windows], https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/blob/master/raspberry_pi_installation.md#installing-signal-k[Linux] or macOS.

=== Available instruments

==== Simple number

Simple instrument displaying a numerical value of one Signal K path with configurable formatting and transformations.

Example uses: speed, wind speed, temperature, voltage, heading etc.

* xref:simplenumberinstrument.adoc[Detailed documentation]

==== Simple gauge

Simple gauge instrument displaying a numerical value of one Signal K path with configurable formatting and transformations.
Especially suitable for angles, directions and ratios, but also supports arbitrary numerical values.

Example uses: wind angle, COG, tank level, like `environment.wind.angleApparent` or `tank.*.currentLevel`

* xref:simplegaugeinstrument.adoc[Detailed documentation]

==== Simple text

Simple instrument displaying a textual Signal K value. The instrument is not suitable to display compound balues like position, use the respective specialozed instruments for these.

Example uses: all Signal K `enum` paths, like `navigation.state`

* xref:simpletextinstrument.adoc[Detailed documentation]

==== Simple position

Simple instrument displaying a geographic position in configurable text format.

Example uses: all Signal K position paths, like `navigation.position`

* xref:simplepositioninstrument.adoc[Detailed documentation]

==== Simple histogram

Simple instrument showing history of a single Signal K path numerical value.

* xref:simplehistograminstrument.adoc[Detailed documentation]
