[[own-vessel]]
=== Own vessel identifier (1)

Signal K context of the own vessel. The initial *vessels.* must be ommited. The value is normally filled automatically as soon as it is received from the OpenCPN core application and there is no need to edit it manually.

=== Configuration data editor (2)

The JSON configuration data of the plugin can be edited directly using a visual editor after clicking on the *Cfg edit* button. This option is recommended for experienced users and general caution is strongly recommended.

=== Dashboard Export and Import (10)
The buttons in the lower left corner allow exporting the complete definition of the current dashboard and all the instruments it contains to a JSON file which can be imported back to the plugin. All the keys refering to own vessel are converted to *vessel.self* during export. During import, the *vessel.self* paths are converted to point to the paths refering to the <<own-vessel,own vessel identifier>>.

=== Preferences persistency (11)
The changes in configuration are reflected in the displayed instruments as soon as feasible - dashboard appearance settings immediately, instrument settings as soon as an action is performed out of the <<instrument-settings, instrument settings>> part of the dialog.
This allows an immediate inspection of the effect of the configuration changes performed, but the configuration is persisted and permanently applied only after the *OK* button in the lower right corner of the preferences is pressed.
In case the *Cancel* button is pressed or the dialog is closed, the plugin remembers the original state of the configuration from the moment the preferences dialog was opened and reverts back to it.
